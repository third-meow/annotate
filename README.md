## Annotate

Trying to create an application to create opencv-style annotation files containing the coordinates of objects within a picture

In other words, Annotate will show the user an image, they'll use the mouse to draw a box around an object in the image, and then Annotate will write this information to a file. This can be done repeatedly for many images relatively quickly
